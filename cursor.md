   - Largest session capacity
   - Central location
   - Community activities

2. **Secondary venues will fluctuate based on:**

   - Time of day
   - Session types

Tips for Attendees:
1. Plan for extra travel time to/from Venetian, especially before keynotes
2. Consider alternate routes between venues during peak times
3. Book sessions in the same venue for consecutive time slots when possible
4. Allow extra time for venue transitions during high-traffic periods

2. 15:00-16:00 - Chalk talk
3. 15:00-17:00 - Workshop (though this overlaps with the Chalk talk)
