2. The Venetian hosts the most sessions across all days
3. Chalk talks are concentrated heavily on the first day
4. Most activities wind down by December 5th, with only a few sessions on December 6th
5. Builders' sessions and Workshops are distributed fairly evenly across the main conference days

Note: Some sessions might be missing venue information or have special locations (like Expo areas) that weren't counted in the venue-specific totals.
